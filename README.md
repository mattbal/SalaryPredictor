# Salary Predictor

By Matt Balint and Evan Kimmerlein

A simple Machine Learning program that predicts a STEM job seeker's salary based off of years of experience, location, company name, and job type. The data set is from Kaggle and contains 62,000 salary records scraped from Levels.fyi

The program uses a Multi Linear Regression algorithm for prediction. To improve the performance of the algorithm, we restricted predictions to fewer attributes (like only Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Cisco, or Google for the company attribute).
